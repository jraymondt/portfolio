            A Portfolio if you like, all written by the ghost piloting the human meat-bag labeled James Raymond Thompson.

            <h3>Episode I: The Phantom Jimbob</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1979. I grew up in the suburbs of Perth and spent my formative working years at the Windsor Hotel in South Perth.</p>
            <br> 
            <p>I was a cook, I learned the ways of the kitchen and learned to work with my hands, to create things with my mind.</p>
            <br> 
            <p>I honed some very rudimentary crafting skills in HTML using frontpage98 in the late 90's and early 2000s.</p> 
              <br>
            <p>In my naivety I thought I could make a website and get paid for it. So designed, photographed and knocked together a website for the Windsor Hotel.</p>

            <h3>Episode II: Hospitality of the Clones</h3>
              <br> 
            <p>I spent the next 20 years in hospitality, working in some of the best hotels in Perth, including Liar's Saloon, JoeBlacks and the BelEyre Tavern.</p>
              <br> 
            <p>If you are wondering why none of these places exist anymore, it's because they crumbled into fine cheese particles after they were destroyed by the Galactic Empire.</p>

            <h3>Episode III: Revenge of the Dish</h3> 
              <br>
            <p>We will just skip this one and the other, it was a dark time for the galaxy. </p>

              <h3>Episode IV: A New Hope</h3>
              <br> 
            <p>I was a courier; I leaned into driving and delivering packages to rebel scum. 
              I re-ignited my passion for web development and have been waiting for the right time to return to it.
              I finished Cert IV Web Development at North Metro TAFE in 2021 and after some time in the local government sector I have returned in 2025 to what I love, running web code down the internet pipelines.
